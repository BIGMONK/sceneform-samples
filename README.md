Sceneform Samples for Android
=====================
Copyright (c) 2018 Google LLC

Sceneform is a 3D framework, with a physically based renderer, that's
optimized for mobile, and that makes it easy for Java developers to
build augmented reality apps.

These samples demonstrate how to use Sceneform beyond the [reference
samples](https://github.com/google-ar/sceneform-android-sdk) that accompany the SDK.

Getting Started
---------------

The **Lighting sample** demonstrates how to add lights to your scene and
experiment with position, color, and intensity.


The **Drawing sample** demonstrates how to use procedural geometry to 
create a 3D drawing experience.
